# Inference_RoboND

DIGITS (the Deep Learning GPU Training System) is a
web-app for training deep learning models. Classification
is one of these model which DIGITS can help to create
using well-known networks like ALexNet and GoogleNet.
the project idea is to classify some of Egyptian banknotes
which will help blind people to identify their cash-flow
and make it easy for them to deal with money in everyday
situations. The idea will be initially implemented on 200LE,
100LE and 50LE using both AlexNet and GoogleNet to
find the most accurate model to deploy it in the embedded
frame.
